# Helpers

Implement the functions in helpers.c such that a user can apply grayscale, reflection, blur, or edge detection filters to their images.

The function grayscale should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
The reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.
The blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
The edges function should take an image and highlight the edges between objects, according to the Sobel operator.
